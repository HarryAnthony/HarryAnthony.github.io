[Apr. 2024] I was invited as a guest on the [MICCAI Student Board Webinar Series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOmXBIWOcg8), where I took part in a panel discussion on MICCAI reviews, rebuttals, workshop papers and challenges.

[Jan. 2024] I have been elected as the PR Officer for the MICCAI Student Board 2024! I will be producing social media content to help contribute to the growth and inclusivity of the community!
