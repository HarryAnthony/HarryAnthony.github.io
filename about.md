## Harry Anthony

Hello world! My name is Harry Anthony and I am a DPhil student at the University of Oxford. As part of the IBME group, my research focuses on improving the reliability of deep neural networks in the field of medical imaging, with a particular emphasis on Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. OOD detection is critical for ensuring the accuracy and safety of medical imaging systems, as it helps to identify when input data differs from its training data. Through my research, I aim to develop novel methods for deep learning algorithms to detect OOD inputs and improve the overall performance of medical imaging systems. Prior to my doctoral studies, I obtained a first class master's degree in Physics from Imperial College London. I am passionate about applying my expertise to the field of medical imaging and am excited about the potential impact of my work on improving patient care and advancing the field.
